= Asteroids

A clone of Atari's 1979 hit, Asteroids.

== TODO

* Add session high score in the top/center
* Add local high score list (3 initials + score)
* Add blinking engine graphic
* Add 3 asteroid breaking sounds (large is deep, medium less so, small not)
* Add flying saucer (large and small)
* Add additional Asteroids graphics (random choice on spawn)
* Perhaps move from image to primitives...
* Wait to spawn - don't spawn into an asteroid (use a box to determine)
* Add ship explosion animation (breaking into vectors)
* Add streaking (like the classic vector arcade)
* Add pulsating projectile (much brighter than everything else, more exciting - classic arcade)
* Make projectile life distance based rather than game loop time
* Flickering engine graphic and sound
* Add right and left aligned text (score/level/etc)
* Make menus more appropriate to the original
* Fix hitbox on player's ship - overlaps should not occur
* Add music sounds that increase in frequency to induce tension in the player
* Add command line option for screen resolution and windowed/fullscreen

== Contributions

* Ariel H. Pillet - Refactorings, sounds, and more
* Ben Scheirman   - Game programming advice, improved hitboxes, particles v2, rotation
